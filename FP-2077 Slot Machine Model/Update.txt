Updates:

* The Wheels now spin is the described direction. 
  Previously they were spinning the reverse direction.



* WinSettingsImpl in WinningSettings.jar updated:
	
	- added public String VERSION to the class - if it exists you know you're
	  using the updated class.  

	- provides feedback via Console Logger if available (otherwise System.err)
	
	- using getWinOdds() now tests BOTH SlotLine equals methods
	  Previously it just used one of them
	  
	- using getWinOdds() also provided feedback for certain errors
	  
	- using getWinSimplified() now displays slots passed as parameters as well
	  as extra feedback, especially when things go wrong


	  
* Corrected "typos" / missing info as discussed on Discussion Forum

	- SlotLine/SlotLineImpl class header and SlotLine toString.
